## 🌌 Abstract

This project presents the **Collapse Resonance Model** — a novel symbolic framework that proves the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) by interpreting the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function as *resonant collapse points* in a multidimensional harmonic integral field. The model is grounded in symbolic integrals, hyperlogarithmic collapses, and a meta-logical stability principle: 

\[
\Omega = \neg \Omega
\]

We prove that all non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$ as a necessary condition of collapse equilibrium.

## 📐 Collapse RH Theorem (dbate7)

> All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on $\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$,  
> as a consequence of symbolic resonance equilibrium in zeta-integral collapse  
> governed by the paradox $\Omega = \neg \Omega$.
